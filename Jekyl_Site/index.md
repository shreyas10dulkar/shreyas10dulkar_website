##Analytics Work Experience/Projects: 

1. [PayActiv Customer Usage Analysis](https://shreyas10dulkar.github.io/PayActivProject)                                  Leading a team of business analysts consulting PayActiv Inc.; a SV Fin-Tech startup that provides an “income advance” service to low/medium income employees, thereby reducing their financial stress between paychecks.  The analytics goals include: 

 - Coming up with metrics like employment engagement and productivity using econometric analysis on transaction and survey data to show that there is a causal link with using PayActiv’s service. 

 - Using Behavioral Analytics on web/app session data to find patterns that indicate improvement in the financial health of employees. Comparing this to similar metrics generated from users of “Payday Loans”. The product is still in its seed funding stages and we want to show customers (employers) that the service is beneficial to them in terms of improving the productivity and engagement of their employees and in some cases reducing their turnover ratio and related expenses


2. [Zales Training Project](https://shreyas10dulkar.github.io/ZalesTraining)                                              Analyzed over 3 million training and transaction records collected over 4 years by Zale’s, to provide insight into the impact and effectiveness of an in house training exercise. Using econometric analysis, constructed models that can help the business understand which parts of the training program were effective in increasing sales and reducing returns at their stores; so they can be managed better in the future.
